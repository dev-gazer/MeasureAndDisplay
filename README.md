# MeasureAndDisplay

- This is an open source project for reading and displaying room temperature and relative air humidity on a I2CLCD1602 display using a Raspberry Pi and a DHT sensor.

- This simple project is based on FreeNove Tutorials and their Starter Kit. The main difference is that this project has a modern C++ structure with object orientation and attention to some performance and security best practices.

- A Makefile is also included.
